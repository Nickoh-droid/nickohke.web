      <h2>My First Day in College — The Wrong Class</h2>
      <p class="date">Published on March 5, 2025</p>

      <p>
        It was my first day of class at Mukiria Technical Training Institute, and everything felt new and exciting.
        The timetable showed “Lab 1,” but I had no idea where that was. I decided to ask a friendly-looking comrade
        for directions, and he confidently pointed me toward a computer lab.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once I got there, I saw computers all around and thought, “This must be it.” Without a second thought, I entered,
        took out my pen and notebook, and began to write what was on the board — “Web Development.”
        Everyone was quiet, listening attentively to the teacher. It felt just right.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then the teacher stopped and looked directly at me. “Hey, young man, where have you come from?” he asked.
        I froze. I didn’t know what to say. “Do you belong here?” he continued. I said yes, though I wasn’t sure.
        He asked if I knew anyone in the room — and of course, I didn’t. The whole class went silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The teacher smiled slightly and said, “You might be in the wrong class.” My heart dropped.
        I looked around; everyone was staring at me. He told me to stand, pack my things, and find my correct class.
        The worst part? He didn’t even tell me where it was. I walked out, embarrassed, not knowing where to go next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, that experience taught me something real about college life — that it’s not like high school.
        You’re expected to find your way, to ask questions, and to take responsibility for your path.
        It was an awkward start, but it became a story I’ll never forget.
